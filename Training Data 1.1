Trump signed a Proclamation titled 'Restrictions on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers' that restricts the entry into the United States of certain H-1B aliens as nonimmigrant workers.

It also directs the Secretary of Labor to revise prevailing wage levels for the H-1B program and the Secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize high-skilled, high-paid H-1B workers. The proclamation is effective from 12:01 a.m. EDT on September 21, 2025, and expires after twelve months unless extended.",

    "Explained": "Yo, so basically Trump dropped this rule that's gonna make it crazy expensive for tech companies to hire smart people from other countries. They're slapping a $100k fee on these H-1B visas, and it also changes how wages are calculated to prioritize higher-paid workers. The idea is to make companies hire Americans instead, but a lot of people are saying it's gonna mess up the tech scene, hurt innovation, and might not even be legal. It's a whole thing, and big companies like Microsoft and Amazon were briefed on it, but reactions are mixed with some panic in the industry.",

It's supposed to push bosses to hire Americans first and stop undercutting local jobs. But yo, it might make it harder for NYC's tech scene to get the talent it needs, and some say it's gonna drive up costs for everyone."

To stop the whole government from shutting down, the House passed this temporary fix on September 19, 2025, like putting a band-aid on it. But the Senate's not having it because the Democrats want to talk about healthcare stuff, and the Republicans are like 'nah.' So now we're just waiting to see if they'll get their act together or if everyone's getting furloughed. Classic Washington drama, and it could lead to a partial shutdown if no deal is reached.",

They put out this super serious rule on January 8, 2025, that basically blocks or puts a ton of restrictions on any company that's moving large amounts of sensitive info—like health records or location data—to those places. It's a huge deal for any business that works internationally, and it's gonna cost them a bag to make sure they're following the rules.

This one lets them tell the apps, 'Look, I'm not going past this street,' or 'I'm not taking that bridge.' So the apps can't just send them on some wild goose chase from the UES to deep Brooklyn for one order.

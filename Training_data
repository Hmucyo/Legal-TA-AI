"Policy": "Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a Proclamation to restrict the entry into the United States of certain H-1B aliens as nonimmigrant workers, requiring a $100,000 payment to accompany or supplement H-1B petitions for new applications to curb abuses that displace U.S. workers and undermine national security.",
"Category": "Presidential Proclamation",
"Target": "U.S. technology companies, employers reliant on H-1B visas, and prospective high-skilled foreign workers.",
"Explained": "Yo, so basically Trump dropped this rule that's gonna make it crazy expensive for tech companies to hire smart people from other countries. They're slapping a $100k fee on these H-1B visas. The idea is to make companies hire Americans instead, but a lot of people are saying it's gonna mess up the tech scene and might not even be legal. It's a whole thing."

"Policy": "The House passed legislation Friday morning that would keep the government open through Nov. 21 to avert an October shutdown and buy more time for bipartisan negotiations over full-year spending bills. The measure would extend government funding generally at current levels for seven weeks.",
"Category": "Bill",
"Target": "All U.S. federal government agencies, federal employees, and recipients of federal funding.",
"Explained": "Aight, so Congress is beefing again and can't agree on a budget. To stop the whole government from shutting down, the House passed this temporary fix, like putting a band-aid on it. But the Senate's not having it because the Democrats want to talk about healthcare stuff, and the Republicans are like 'nah.' So now we're just waiting to see if they'll get their act together or if everyone's getting furloughed. Classic."

"Policy": "The Department of Justice is issuing a final rule to implement Executive Order 14117 of February 28, 2024 (Preventing Access to Americans' Bulk Sensitive Personal Data and United States Government-Related Data by Countries of Concern), by prohibiting and restricting certain data transactions with certain countries or covered persons.",
"Category": "Final Rule",
"Target": "U.S. persons and companies engaged in data brokerage, or with vendor, employment, or investment agreements involving the transfer of bulk sensitive personal data to 'countries of concern' (e.g., China, Russia, Iran) or entities they control.",
"Explained": "So check it, the government is getting real paranoid about countries like China and Russia getting their hands on our data. They put out this super serious rule that basically blocks or puts a ton of restrictions on any company that's moving large amounts of sensitive info—like health records or location data—to those places. It's a huge deal for any business that works internationally, and it's gonna cost them a bag to make sure they're following the rules."

Each third-party food delivery service and third-party courier service shall provide each food delivery worker with the ability to specify: 1. the maximum distance per trip... 2. that such worker will not accept trips that require travel over any bridge... and 3. that such worker will not accept trips that require travel through any tunnel...",
"Category": "Local Law",
"Target": "Third-party food and courier delivery service platforms (e.g., Uber Eats, DoorDash, Grubhub) and the food delivery workers they contract with in New York City.",
"Explained": "Bet. So you know all those delivery guys flying around the city on their e-bikes? The City Council finally passed some laws to look out for them. This one lets them tell the apps, 'Look, I'm not going past this street,' or 'I'm not taking that bridge.' So the apps can't just send them on some wild goose chase from the UES to deep Brooklyn for one order. It gives the workers a little more control, which is only right."

"Policy": "BEFORE AN OWNER OF A RENTAL HOUSING ACCOMMODATION MAY SELL OR ACCEPT AN OFFER TO SELL A RENTAL HOUSING ACCOMMODATION, THE OWNER SHALL GIVE EACH TENANT, TENANT ORGANIZATION OR QUALIFIED PURCHASER AN OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE SUCH RENTAL HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AT A PRICE AND TERMS THAT REPRESENT A BONA FIDE OFFER OF SALE.",
"Category": "Bill",
"Target": "Owners of rental housing accommodations, tenants, tenant organizations, and qualified non-profit purchasers in New York State.",
"Explained": "Real talk, the housing situation here is a mess. So Albany is trying to do something about it. This one bill, if it passes, would be wild. It basically says if your landlord wants to sell the building, they have to offer it to you and the other tenants first before some big real estate company can swoop in. It's supposed to help people stay in their homes and keep neighborhoods from getting flipped overnight."

{
"Policy": "A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act with respect to the scheduling of fentanyl-related substances, and for other purposes.",
"Category": "Public Law",
"Target": "Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), law enforcement agencies, and individuals involved in the manufacturing or distribution of illicit drugs.",

"Category": "Public Law (Joint Resolution)",
"Target": "Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), California Air Resources Board (CARB), and automobile manufacturers.",
"Explained": "So California has its own tough rules for car pollution, and the EPA was cool with it. But now Congress is stepping in and saying 'nah, we're canceling that rule.' It's a whole fight between states' rights and the federal government over electric cars and climate change stuff."

},
{
"Policy": "A joint resolution disapproving the rule submitted by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection relating to 'Overdraft Lending: Very Large Financial Institutions'.",
"Category": "Public Law (Joint Resolution)",
"Target": "Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB), large banks, and bank customers.",
"Explained": "You know those overdraft fees that banks hit you with? The consumer protection agency made a rule to limit them, but Congress just voted to kill it. So, the big banks can keep charging those crazy fees. It's a win for the banks, not so much for us."
},
{
"Policy": "Making further continuing appropriations and other extensions for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025, and for other purposes.",
"Category": "Public Law",
"Target": "U.S. federal government agencies and employees.",
"Explained": "This is another one of those 'kick the can down the road' laws. Congress couldn't agree on a real budget, so they passed this to keep the government funded for a little while longer and avoid a shutdown. It's like paying the minimum on your credit card."
},
{
"Policy": "Adoption and Procedures of the Section 232 Automobile Parts Tariff Inclusions Process.",
"Category": "Final Rule",
"Target": "Automobile manufacturers, auto parts importers, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
"Explained": "Basically, the government is putting tariffs, which are like taxes, on car parts coming from other countries. They're saying it's for 'national security,' but really it means cars and car repairs could get more expensive. This rule is about the process for companies to argue that certain parts shouldn't have the tax."

"Category": "Final Rule",
"Target": "U.S. exporters of technology and specific foreign companies and individuals.",
"Explained": "The government has this 'Entity List,' which is basically a blacklist of foreign companies they think are sketchy. This rule adds more companies to that list. If you're an American company, you can't sell certain tech to them without getting a special license, which is almost impossible. It's all part of the tech cold war with China."

"Category": "Final Rule",
"Target": "Commercial fishermen in the South Atlantic region.",
"Explained": "The government is telling all the commercial fishing boats in the South Atlantic that they have to stop catching red snapper for the rest of the year. They do this when they think too many fish have been caught, to try and make sure there are still fish left for the future. Sucks if you're a fisherman, though."

"Category": "Notice",
"Target": "Syrian nationals residing in the United States under Temporary Protected Status (TPS).",
"Explained": "This is heavy. The government is ending the 'Temporary Protected Status' for people from Syria. That means Syrians who were allowed to stay here because of the war back home might have to leave the country. It's a huge deal for thousands of people."
},
{
"Policy": "Increased Assessment Rate: Irish Potatoes Grown in Certain Designated Counties in Idaho, and Malheur County, OR.",
"Category": "Final Rule",
"Target": "Potato growers in specific counties of Idaho and Oregon.",
"Explained": "This is some deep-cut government stuff. They're making potato farmers in parts of Idaho and Oregon pay a slightly higher fee to a board that promotes potatoes. It's like a mandatory marketing fee to get everyone to buy more french fries, I guess."
},
{
"Policy": "Implementation of Refund Procedures for Craft Beverage Modernization Act Federal Excise Tax Benefits Applicable to Imported Alcohol.",
"Category": "Final Rule",
"Target": "Importers of foreign alcoholic beverages.",
"Explained": "This is for the people who import booze.

"Category": "Law (State)",
"Target": "New York State Department of Transportation, wineries, and tourism industry in the Finger Lakes region.",
"Explained": "This is some upstate business. They're officially naming a highway route in the Finger Lakes the 'Wine Trail.' It's basically a branding move to get more tourists to come drink wine up there. Not a bad idea, honestly."

{
"Policy": "Waives the residency requirement for the office of commissioner of finance of the county of Putnam.",
"Category": "Law (State)",
"Target": "Putnam County government and potential candidates for the commissioner of finance position.",
"Explained": "So, some government jobs upstate make you live in the county where you work. This law says the main money person for Putnam County doesn't have to live there anymore. They're probably having a hard time finding someone qualified who actually wants to live in Putnam."

"Category": "Local Law",
"Target": "Businesses that supply construction workers (labor brokers) and construction workers.",
"Explained": "There are these companies that are basically temp agencies for construction sites. This law makes them get a license and follow a bunch of rules to make sure they're not screwing over the workers. It's supposed to stop shady bosses from exploiting people."
},
{

"Category": "Local Law",
"Target": "Movie theaters in New York City and deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals.",
"Explained": "This is actually pretty cool. The city is making movie theaters show more movies with open captions, you know, the subtitles that are right on the screen. It's for people who are deaf or hard of hearing so they can actually go to the movies and know what's going on. It's about making things more accessible, you feel me?"

"Category": "Law (State)",
"Target": "New York State Public Employment Relations Board (PERB), private sector employers, and labor unions.",
"Explained": "So the national board that handles union stuff is kinda messed up right now. This state law lets New York's own labor board step in and handle disputes between companies and unions if the feds can't get their act together. It's like a backup plan to protect workers' rights."

"Category": "Law (State)",
"Target": "Public sector unions and their members in New York State.",

"Category": "Law (State)",
"Target": "Construction contractors in the renewable energy sector and labor unions.",
"Explained": "So New York is going big on green energy, right? This law says that the companies building all these solar panels and wind turbines have to use official apprenticeship programs.

"Category": "Zoning Text Amendment",
"Target": "Real estate developers, property owners, and residents in all New York City neighborhoods.",
"Explained": "The city is trying to fix the housing crisis by changing the rules for what you can build and where.

The idea is to create more apartments, but some people are worried it's gonna change their neighborhoods too much."

"Category": "Bill (Local)",
"Target": "Homeowners of one- and two-family houses in New York City.",
"Explained": "This is about legalizing stuff like basement apartments and backyard cottages. The city is setting up rules so homeowners can legally build and rent out these small apartments on their property. It's another way they're trying to add more housing options in the city."
},
{
"Policy": "Introduction 814-A, would require that the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) update the sewer backup prevention plan by 2025 and conduct regular updates thereafter.",

"Target": "New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and city residents, particularly in flood-prone areas.",
"Explained": "Remember when the subways and everyone's basement got flooded? This bill is making the city update its plan to stop sewers from backing up during heavy rain. They have to do it every five years to keep up with climate change and all the crazy weather we've been getting."
},
{

"Category": "Bill (Local)",
"Target": "Transgender and gender non-conforming individuals seeking healthcare, and healthcare providers.",
"Explained": "So other states are passing these wild anti-trans laws. This NYC bill is basically a shield.

"Category": "Directive / Regulation",
"Target": "Journalists and media organizations covering the Department of Defense.",
"Explained": "The Pentagon is putting new rules on reporters. If they want to get into the building, they have to sign a pledge not to publish certain info, even if it's not officially 'classified.' It's a major crackdown on the press and what they can report about the military."

"Category": "Bill (State)",
"Target": "Housing developers, environmental agencies, and local governments in New York State.",
"Explained": "Building anything in New York takes forever because of all the environmental reviews. This bill would fast-track the approval process for new apartment buildings in areas that are already developed. The idea is to build more housing faster without creating suburban sprawl."

"Category": "Bill (State)",
"Target": "First-time homebuyers in New York State.",
"Explained": "Buying a place in New York is basically impossible. This bill would let you open a special savings account for a down payment, and you wouldn't have to pay state taxes on the money you put in. It's supposed to make it a little easier to save up and finally own a home."

"Category": "Bill (State)",
"Target": "Residents of manufactured home parks (trailer parks) and park owners.",
"Explained": "This is for people who live in trailer parks. The owners can't just jack up the rent by a crazy amount anymore. If they want to raise it more than 3%, they have to explain why in writing. It gives residents a way to fight back against unfair rent hikes."

"Category": "Bill (Local)",
"Target": "New York City building owners and tenants.",
"Explained": "Legionnaires' disease is this nasty pneumonia you can get from bad water systems. The City Council is considering a bill that would make landlords give tenants info about it and also provide detachable shower hoses, which are apparently safer. It's all about public health."

"Category": "Bill (Local)",

"Category": "Bill (Local)",
"Target": "Owners of buildings with cooling towers in New York City.",

"Explained": "The Commerce Secretary is out here saying all the big tech companies are cool with the new $100k fee for H-1B visas. It sounds like the White House is trying to get ahead of the backlash by claiming the industry is on board, but we'll see if that's actually true. It's a power move."

"Category": "Legislative Action (Senate Block)",
"Target": "US Senate, federal government agencies, and the American public.",
"Explained": "The House passed a bill to keep the government open, but the Democrats in the Senate blocked it. They're holding out because they want to force a negotiation on healthcare funding. It's a high-stakes game of chicken, and if nobody swerves, the government shuts down."

"Category": "Legislative Trend Analysis",
"Target": "The 119th U.S. Congress.",
"Explained": "This is less a policy and more of a fact, but it's wild. This current Congress has barely passed any new laws. Most of what they've done is just undoing stuff the last president did. It's a perfect picture of the gridlock in DC; they're more focused on fighting the last war than doing anything new."

"Target": "U.S. companies involved in data brokerage, vendor, employment, and investment agreements with foreign entities.",
"Explained": "The DOJ is officially saying that it's a national security risk for American companies to make certain data deals with foreign countries. This isn't a law yet, but it's the official reason they're using to justify the new rules cracking down on data sales. They're drawing a line in the sand."

"Explained": "The new data security rule has two levels. Some deals are straight-up banned, like you can't do them at all. Others are 'restricted,' meaning you can do them, but you have to follow a bunch of strict security rules. It's making companies really think about who they're doing business with."
},
{
"Policy": "The rule also specifies certain classes of transactions that are exempt. These include, but are not limited to, transactions for the official business of the U.S. Government by its employees, grantees, or contractors; transactions required or authorized by Federal law or international agreements; financial services; corporate group transactions; telecommunications services...",
"Category": "Regulatory Exemption",
"Target": "U.S. government contractors, financial institutions, and telecommunication companies.",
"Explained": "Even though the new data security rules are super strict, there are some exceptions. If you're doing work for the U.S. government, or you're a bank or a phone company, a lot of the rules don't apply to your normal business. They're trying to target specific risks without shutting down the whole economy."

{
"Policy": "The rule is limited to transactions that are commercial in nature, meaning they involve some form of payment or valuable consideration.",
"Category": "Regulatory Clarification",
"Target": "U.S. entities engaged in commercial data transactions.",
"Explained": "The new data rules are focused on business deals. If you're just collaborating on research with someone overseas and no money is changing hands, the rules probably don't apply. They're targeting the buying and selling of our data, not just sharing information."

"Category": "Local Law",
"Target": "Construction labor providers (temp agencies) and construction workers in NYC.",
"Explained": "There are a lot of shady temp agencies for construction that exploit workers. This law forces them to get a license from the city and follow the rules. It's about protecting workers from getting ripped off or put in dangerous situations."

"Target": "App-based food delivery services and their workers in NYC.",

"Category": "Law (State)",
"Target": "Private employers, labor unions, and the NYS Public Employment Relations Board.",
"Explained": "The federal agency that's supposed to handle union issues is basically broken. So, New York passed a law that says our state labor board can step in and handle cases between companies and unions if the feds are dropping the ball. It's a way to make sure workers still have rights."

"Category": "Bill (Local)",
"Target": "App-based grocery delivery services (like Instacart) and their workers.",
"Explained": "This is the bill that actually makes the minimum pay happen for grocery delivery workers. Once the city agency figures out the pay rate, this law will force the apps to pay their workers at least that much. It's a huge deal for those workers."
},
{
"Policy": "The effective date of the bill including minimum-pay rate protections for grocery delivery workers is tied to the enactment of other legislation related to safe delivery access for contracted delivery workers, which is currently awaiting the mayor's signature.",
"Category": "Legislative Detail",
"Target": "App-based grocery delivery workers.",
"Explained": "This is some inside baseball, but the minimum pay for grocery delivery workers won't start until another related bill gets signed into law. It's how they link different pieces of legislation together to make sure a whole package of reforms happens at once."
},
{
"Policy": "The city's own data shows that this bill could drive grocery delivery costs up by a staggering 46%, cut off access to work for thousands of NYC delivery workers, and increase fees on local grocers.",
"Category": "Policy Opposition Argument",
"Target": "New York City Council and consumers.",
"Explained": "This is the other side of the story. The delivery app companies are saying that if the city forces them to pay a minimum wage, they're going to have to raise their prices by almost 50%. They're warning that it will make delivery too expensive and that they'll have to hire fewer workers."
},
{
"Policy": "The rights to limit delivery distance and route, get trip information before accepting a delivery, get paid weekly without payment fees, and get an insulated bag took effect on April 22, 2022.",
"Category": "Local Law (Effective Date)",
"Target": "App-based food delivery workers in NYC.",
"Explained": "This is just a reminder of the rights that food delivery workers already have. As of April 2022, they can limit their delivery distance, they have to be told the pay and tip upfront, they have to get paid weekly, and the company has to give them an insulated bag. The minimum pay part came later."
},
{
"Policy": "For every trip, before workers accept an offer, apps must tell workers all of the following: Pickup location address. Estimated time and distance for the trip. Amount of any tip selected by a customer. Amount of pay or the hourly pay rate the worker will receive for the trip, without counting tips.",
"Category": "Local Law (Transparency Requirement)",
"Target": "App-based delivery services.",
"Explained": "This law is all about transparency. Before a delivery worker accepts a job, the app has to tell them exactly where they're going, how long it should take, how much the app is paying them, and how much the customer tipped. No more mystery trips for low pay."
},
{
"Policy": "Apps must offer at least one no-fee option for workers to get paid.",
"Category": "Local Law (Payment Requirement)",
"Target": "App-based delivery services.",
"Explained": "Some apps were charging their workers fees just to get their own money, which is wild. This law makes that illegal. The apps have to give workers at least one way to get paid, like direct deposit, that doesn't have any fees attached."
},
{
"Policy": "A third-party food delivery service or third-party courier service shall not offer any food delivery worker any trip that is inconsistent with the parameters established by such worker and shall not penalize a food delivery worker for selecting or changing such parameters.",
"Category": "Local Law (Worker Protection)",
"Target": "App-based delivery services.",
"Explained": "This backs up the law that lets workers set their own distance limits. It makes it illegal for the app to offer them a job that goes beyond their limit, and it also says the app can't punish them for using the feature, like by giving them fewer offers in the future."
},
{
"Policy": "The legislation reflects the most comprehensive attempt to curb the food delivery apps' employment practices by any city in the country.",
"Category": "Policy Analysis",
"Target": "New York City Council and app-based delivery companies.",
"Explained": "This isn't a policy itself, but it's the takeaway. New York City's package of laws for delivery workers is the toughest and most detailed in the entire country. The city is really leading the way in trying to regulate the gig economy."
},
{
"Policy": "In 2021, the Council passed a package of bills establishing minimum wages and working conditions for delivery workers who contract with third-party food delivery platforms.",
"Category": "Legislative History",
"Target": "NYC food delivery workers.",
"Explained": "This just gives some background. The big push to protect delivery workers in NYC started back in 2021 when the City Council passed the first set of major laws that eventually led to things like minimum pay and the right to set your own delivery distance."
},
{
"Policy": "The bill would also require the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) to study working conditions and determine a minimum pay rate for contracted delivery workers.",
"Category": "Local Law (Mandate)",
"Target": "NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP).",
"Explained": "This law gave a city agency, the DCWP, a specific job: to study how much delivery workers actually make and what their expenses are, and then use that data to come up with a fair minimum pay rate. It's about making a decision based on facts, not just what the companies say."
},
{
"Policy": "The bill would also amend the effective dates of Int. 2288-A and Int. 2294-A to provide that such local laws would take effect on the same date as Int. 2289-A.",
"Category": "Legislative Procedure",
"Target": "New York City Council.",
"Explained": "This is some technical government stuff. They passed a few different bills for delivery workers, and this just makes sure they all officially start on the same day. It's just coordinating the paperwork to make sure all the new rules kick in together."

"Policy": "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring building owners to provide shower hoses and informational materials on Legionnaires' disease to tenants.",
"Category": "Bill (Local)",
"Target": "Landlords and tenants in New York City.",
"Explained": "The city is looking at a new law to fight Legionnaires' disease. It would make landlords give all their tenants info about the disease and also provide those detachable shower heads, which are supposed to be safer and easier to clean. It's a public health thing."

"Policy": "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to cooling tower inspections in heat-related emergencies.",
"Category": "Bill (Local)",
"Target": "Owners of large buildings with cooling towers.",
"Explained": "Those big AC units on top of buildings, cooling towers, can spread Legionnaires' disease if they're not clean. This proposed law would require them to be inspected during heat waves, when they're running non-stop, to make sure they're not making people sick."

"Category": "Bill (Local)",
"Target": "Supplemental sanitation service providers (like Business Improvement Districts).",
"Explained": "You know how some neighborhoods have those extra clean-up crews in uniforms? This bill would let them put the trash they collect next to the regular city trash cans for pickup. It's a small change to make it easier for them to keep the streets clean."
},
{
"Policy": "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to online submission of citizen's complaints to enforce dumping prohibition laws.",
"Category": "Bill (Local)",
"Target": "New York City residents and the Department of Sanitation.",
"Explained": "If you see someone illegally dumping trash, this bill would make it easier to report them. It would require the city to set up a system so you can file a complaint and submit evidence, like a photo or video, online. It's about using technology to catch grimy people."

"Policy": "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to adding two commissioners to the New York city taxi and limousine commission board.",
"Category": "Bill (Local)",
"Target": "The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).",
"Explained": "The City Council wants to add two more people to the board that runs the TLC, the agency that regulates taxis and Uber. It's a political move to change the balance of power on the board and have more influence over its decisions."

{
"Policy": "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing an office of the census.",
"Category": "Bill (Local)",
"Target": "The government of New York City.",
"Explained": "The census is a huge deal; it determines how much money and political power the city gets. This bill would create a permanent city office to handle the census every ten years. The goal is to make sure every single New Yorker gets counted so we don't get screwed."
},
{
"Policy": "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to enforcing violations against unlicensed commuter vans.",
"Category": "Bill (Local)",
"Target": "Unlicensed commuter van operators and the TLC.",
"Explained": "Those dollar vans can be super sketchy if they're not licensed. This bill is about cracking down on the illegal ones. It would give the TLC more power to enforce the rules and get the dangerous vans off the road."

"Policy": "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to monthly reporting by the director of management and budget on the status of all federal funding.",
"Category": "Bill (Local)",
"Target": "The NYC Office of Management and Budget (OMB).",
"Explained": "The city gets a ton of money from the federal government, but it's hard to track. This bill would force the city's budget office to release a report every month showing all the federal money we're supposed to get and where it's going. It's all about transparency."

"Category": "Local Law",
"Target": "NYC 311 system, Department of Buildings, and residents.",
"Explained": "If your neighbors are having loud parties on the roof, it's hard to complain to 311. This new law makes them create a special category just for rooftop complaints. It also makes the Buildings Department report on what they're doing about illegal rooftop party spots."

"Policy": "The Senate Democratic Majority will advance legislation to further ensure access to affordable housing for all New Yorkers. This legislative package builds on our work and efforts from last year's legislative session to better address housing shortages and rising costs across New York State.",

"Target": "Renters and homeowners in New York State.",
"Explained": "The Democrats in the state senate are announcing that they're pushing a bunch of new bills to deal with the housing crisis. It's not one specific law, but a whole package of them aimed at creating more affordable housing and protecting tenants. It's their big priority."

"Policy": "This bill, S. 2534, would provide a lookback period of up to two years to the original date of eligibility for the senior citizen rent increase exemption (SCRIE) and the Disability Rent Increase Exemption (DRIE).",
"Category": "Bill (State)",
"Target": "Senior citizens and people with disabilities who are eligible for rent freeze programs.",
"Explained": "SCRIE and DRIE are programs that freeze the rent for seniors and people with disabilities. A lot of people don't find out they're eligible until way later. This bill would let them apply retroactively for up to two years, so they can get back the money they overpaid in rent."
